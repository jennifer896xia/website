## Hiking in the Grand Canyon
Let's hop on the shuttle to our first destination, the vast and magical Grand Canyon! 

Prepare for a stunning view of the Grand Canyon as we enter the two-hour hike from South Kaibab Trail to Cedar Ridge. 
Together, we can explore the beauty of the Canyon right by our fingertips. What are you waiting for? Let's go!

The hike down is easy because of the consistent downhill. Watch out! Mules incoming. Perhaps you can compare and contrast the differences between horses, donkeys, and mules.

Wow, what a mouth-gaping view! There are several viewpoints throughout the hike, Ooh-Aah Point, Cedar Ridge, and Skeleton Point. We stopped at the Cedar Ridge point.
As usual, remember to stop whenever it is neccasary. Don't forget to eat, take pictures, and replenish your energy!

One thing for sure: the hike upwards is ten times harder. We finally climbed back to the starting point of the South Kaibab Trail. What magical views we had in the Grand Canyon!
Don't forget to visit daily for more updates and fun expierences with me!
